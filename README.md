# 🚑 Smart Ambulance Dispatch System

An intelligent, one-click emergency response system designed to help hospitals **quickly locate and assign the nearest available ambulance**, using basic **Machine Learning (KNN)** and **location-based logic**.

> 🧠 Built for emergency situations where **every second counts**, this system reduces manual coordination time and supports hospital networks in faster ambulance allocation.

## 💡 Features

- 🆘 **One-Click SOS Interface** – Simple UI for hospital to request an ambulance.
- 📍 **Nearest Ambulance Locator** – Uses KNN to find the closest available unit.
- 🏥 **Hospital Bed Status** – Checks for hospitals with available beds.
- 🤖 **ML-Based Demand Prediction (Optional)** – Forecast busy zones with Random Forest.
- 🧪 **Simulation Ready** – Works with mock ambulance/hospital data.
- 📄 **Python-Based Backend** – Built using Pandas, Scikit-learn, Geopy.
